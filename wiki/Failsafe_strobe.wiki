#failsafe

= Strobe lights =

For short-term switching of lights for LED circuits selected, you can use the analogWrite. Conversely, if you want to further strengthen the strobe effect only for short-term use, no more than 50ms, you can use digitalWrite.

Be sure to use a strobe with LED 3W, gives a very strong visual impact.

== Code ==

If you do not use the selected LED circuits, remove the appropriate line, the control circuit selected, or use the # symbol.
