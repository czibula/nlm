For double circuit if it is plugged only one LED, use the jumper in place of the second diode.

# Examples of applications #

# NLM 1.x #

**Switching on the navigation lights shall be held in the three-position switch on the transmitter RC.**

## ex. 1 ##
switch in position 0 - marker lights <br>
switch in position 1 - lights off <br>
switch in position 2 - marker lights and navigation lights <br>
Turning off the RC transmitter will automatically attach the failsafe mode with strobe flashes all the lights.<br>

<h2>ex. 2</h2>
switch in position 0 - marker lights <br>
switch in position 1 - marker lights and navigation lights  <br>
switch in position 2 - marker lights and navigation lights and landing gear lights<br>
Turning off the RC transmitter will automatically attach the failsafe mode with strobe flashes all the lights.<br>

<h2>ex. 1</h2>
Turning marker lights and navigation lights is done by a three-position switch is in the RC transmitter via the CONN-1.<br>
Landing lights are activated automatically with retractable landing gear control signal on the connector CONN-2.<br>
Beacon Light switches on automatically when you run the engine via the CONN-3.<br>
Turning off the RC transmitter will automatically attach the failsafe mode with strobe flashes all the lights.<br>
After a preset time (default is not 5 seconds.) turn on circuit LED-10.<br>
